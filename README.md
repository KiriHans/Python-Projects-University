# Python Projects University
## What is this?
This repository is consisted of small python projects that I've developed during my Bachelor degree.

## What to expect
Mainly This repository will consist of python files, but it will also contains C++ projects and Makefiles.
Each folder will have an especific project.

## Requirements
You should have installed python 3 and C++ in your computer to run these projects.

## How to
### Python
You should create your own Python environment first ([how to setup virtual environments in python](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-setup-virtual-environments-in-python/)) and install all the packages listed in `requirements.txt` using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt` while inside the environment.

### C++
With having `g++` installed in your computer should be enough.

### Makefile
- If you are using linux, you should have it installed already.
- If you are using windows, [follow this tutorial](https://earthly.dev/blog/makefiles-on-windows/) to install it.
